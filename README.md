Sentiment Analysis Project

Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on text data to determine whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral. The model processes customer feedback or textual data and provides insights into the overall sentiment, which can be useful for business decision-making.

Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning
Sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
Visualization of sentiment distribution
Uses NLP techniques such as tokenization and stopword removal
Implements machine learning models for sentiment classification
